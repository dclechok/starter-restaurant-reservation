# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System Backend

This is the completed backend (RESTful API) to my Restaurant Reservation System application.

This application allows you to create and remove reservations, create tables, and seat reservations at tables. Also, a search is included to allow the user to search throught he database to find reservations by mobile number (or part of mobile number).

This backend includes multiple layers of middleware for validation
